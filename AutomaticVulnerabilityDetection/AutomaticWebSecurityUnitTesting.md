Title:Automatic Web Security Unit Testing:XSS Vulnerability Detection

Objectives:automatic detect Cross Site Scripting(XSS)

Method:Automatic extract encoding functions used in a web application to sanitize untrusted inputs and then evaluate their effectiveness by automatically generating XSS attack strings.

Evaluations:

(1)Can detect 0-day XSS vulneraiblities compared with the static analysis tools

(2)Can efficiently cover a common type of XSS vulnerability.

# 2.Knowledge

(1)Problem

Web application should sanitize untrusted data using <font color="red">output encoding functions</font> before display ing them on web pages.

(2)Common Method

i.static analysis(reference the paper"Static Detection of Cross-site Scripting Vulnerabilites")

But can't verify whether the encoding functions are used correctly.

(3)Contexts

(i)HTML body (ii)HTML attributes (iii)CSS (iv)URL (v)JavaScript

(4)
